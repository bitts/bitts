### üíé About Me

#[Curriculum](https://github.com/bitts/bitts/blob/main/Aboutme.md)

I am from Resende, located in the state of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, but I received a Bachelor's degree in Systems Analysis from Centro Universit√°rio Franciscano (currently UFN - Universidade Franciscana) located in Santa Maria, in the heart of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

I was recently 1st Tenente of the Temporary Technical Officers of the Brazilian Army and performed the role of Adjunct to the Operations Management Section, where I was working in level 2 support (ITIL-Ex) and technical supervision of telecommunications contracts, at the 1¬∫ Telematics Center Area - 1¬∫ CTA, located at the Headquarters of the Southern Military Command in Porto Alegre - Rio Grande do Sul.

I have extensive experience in the custom systems development market and have worked in the educational, industrial, collections, condominium administration, real estate, financial and accounting fields, working from the managerial level, requirements gathering, business understanding, development, implementation, consulting and support.

For almost a decade I worked at Sociedade Vicente Pallotti, a multinational of Pallottine Fathers where in its various branches, which operate in the most diverse fields of activities, including Education, Industry and Agribusiness, I acquired vast experience in the applied area of Computer Science, with an emphasis on Programming Languages and Database. There I was able to acquire vast knowledge in programming logic and high performance algorithms, webservices, systems integration, high complexity SQL queries. I was responsible for managing the most diverse database systems working mainly with MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres and SQLServer. Also there, I obtained technical training in the customization of Educational Management Systems using the TOTVS RM line, where I created reports of the most diverse complexities, such as academic records, bulletins, minutes, minutes, among others, in addition to the direct administration of its database in SQL Server, T-SQL is used to create SQL queries, Storage Produres, Triggers, Views. Learn a little of this work [here](https://github.com/bitts/Consultas-SQL).

As an enthusiast, I taught training and courses on web systems development using PHP language and frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI. In addition to SQL and Database courses.

### ‚òéÔ∏è How to contact me
For quick questions, get in touch via email (bitts@passport.com) and I will probably get back to you as soon as possible. If a longer discussion is needed, we schedule a video conference.

### üö∂ Preferred Work Style
I prefer a lot of collaboration. Typically this means 1-on-1, team meetings and pairing. Normally, I just need a quiet environment when I'm coding. I use my calendar to keep things balanced, if it's not on my calendar, I can get lost.

I try not to force my preconceived notions of what "works" on people. Different situations call for different solutions. That's the essence I believe.

If you're afraid to ask tough questions or express unpopular opinions, then you're not doing your best. I am committed to creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking their minds.

### ü¶æ what motivates me
I want to improve everything around me. I'm a perfectionist, but I realize that perfection is impossible, so I try to improve every day. It's important for me to understand the big picture in order to know the direction I should go.

### üêç what demotivates me
Doing things to do is a waste of time. Everything must have a purpose.

### ‚ú® My values (and what I value in others)
Intentionality - I admire people who put things first and find they tend to be more successful.

Understanding - Seeking to understand first is a critical part of my success.

Teamwork - this is how you make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.

### üßÆ Other
I value feedback, so feel free to request or give feedback from me whenever you like.

This README is a work in progress and I will continue to update it as I learn new things.
